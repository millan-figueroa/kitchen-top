8/3 (fix date) Struggled with login/ auth. We kept trying to login but nothing would show up in userpage. AI gave us the run around. Ended the day with merge conflicts - main page was showing next.js boilerplate before we called it quits. 

8/10 (fix date) M: Added logged in header and styles and fixed merge conflicts 

8/12 Got a lot of stuff done: 
-firebase auth
